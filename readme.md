PhageTB is a multilevel prediction method for predicting interactions between bacteriophages and pathogenic bacterial hosts. This study develops a novel host prediction method for predicting hosts of query phages by their genome sequences utilizing alignment-based and alignment-free features.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/raghavagps/phagetb.git
cd phagetb/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You need to change the following paths in the respective files:
```
temp_path: where the temporary files are stored
base_path: where the source files are stored
blastn_path: where the blastn executable is stored
```

Additionally you need the blastdb files and genome files (in fasta format) for the respective bacterial hosts which can be downloaded [here](https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/phagetb/downloads/blastdb_and_genome.zip) and unzip them in the base path.

```
unzip blastdb_and_genome.zip
```

You can run the model using the following command:
```
python model.py -i input.fasta -o output.csv -l 1 2 3 4
```

## Getting Started

This project is hosted on [PhageTB](https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/phagetb/) and can be accessed by clicking on the link above or can be used as a standalone application by downloading the source code from this GitHub repository.

There are 3 prediction methods available in this model. 
1. Predict The Bacterial Host For A Query Phage (model.py)
This Module Allows Users To Predict The Bacterial Hosts Corresponding To The Query Phages using the genome sequence of the phage. 
1. Predict Interaction Of Query Phage-Bacteria Pair (model_phage_host_pair.py)
This Module Allows Users To Predict Whether Given Phage And Bacterial Hosts Are Likely To Interact With One Another. The prediction from this module for the phage is used as a query for the BLAST task (blastn) against the query bacterial host. The BLAST task is performed using the NCBI BLAST+ tool. The BLAST output is parsed and if the predicted host and query host have a similarity higher than the threshold, then the phage-host pair is predicted to interact.
1. Predict The Lytic Phage For Query Bacteria (model_bacteria.py)
This Module Allow Users To Predict The Target Phage Likely To Infect Query Bacteria.
